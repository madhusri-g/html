      The Dursleys are a well-to-do, status-conscious family living in Surrey,
      England. Eager to keep up proper appearances, they are embarrassed by Mrs.
      Dursley’s eccentric sister, Mrs. Potter, whom for years Mrs. Dursley has
      pretended not to know. On his way to work one ordinary morning, Mr.
      Dursley notices a cat reading a map.
